## Introduction
This repository has the code for ACL'18 paper: To Attend or not to Attend: A Case Study on Syntactic Structures for Semantic Relatedness.

## Dependencies
* Python (tested on 2.7.13)
* [Pytorch](http://pytorch.org/) (tested on 0.2.0_3)
* numpy (tested on 1.14.0)
* scipy (tested on 1.0.0)
* [SICK dataset](http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2014/task1/index.php?id=data-and-tools)
	* TestData (including gold scores)
	* TrainingData
	* TrialData
* [Glove embeddings](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/)
	* Common Crawl (840B)
* I used this [utility library]() for Stanford Parser, Stanford POS Tagger, Stanford Dependency Parser and Stanford Constituency Parser.

## How to run the code?
Download any model(eg. treelstm_const_attn) and please:
* Change ‘–glove’ argument in **config.py** to point to the location of downloaded Glove embeddings.
* Change path of following in **scripts/preprocess-sick.py** to point to downloaded train, trial and test datasets, respectively:
	* file0 ---- location of train dataset file
	* file1 ---- location of trial(dev) dataset file
	* file2 ---- location of test dataset file
* Put the downloaded **utility library** as shown below.
[./markup_imgs/file_structure.png]
* Go to folder **scripts** and run command:
	* python preprocess-sick.py
	* If the command runs successfully, then you should see the output as follows:
	  [./markup_imgs/conf1.png]
* Go to downloaded model folder and run command:
	* python main.py
	* If the command runs successfully, then you should see the output as follows:
	  [./markup_imgs/conf2.png]
